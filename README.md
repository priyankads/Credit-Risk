# Credit-Risk

# Problem Statement
Imagine a bank in your locality. The bank has realized that applying data science methodologies can help them focus their resources efficiently, make smarter decisions on credit risk calculations, and improve performance.
Earlier they used to check the credit risk of the loan applicants manually by analyzing their bank-related data, which used to take months of time. But this time they want a smart data scientist who can automate this process.

# Objective
You are required to build a machine learning model that helps you predict the credit risk of the loan applicants.

# Data Description
There are 20 attributes in the dataset. Some of them are mentioned below:
* checking_status: Status of the existing checking account
* duration: Duration in month
* credit_history: Credit history of the applicant
